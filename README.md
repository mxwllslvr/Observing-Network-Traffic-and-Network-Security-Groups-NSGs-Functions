<h1>Observing Network Traffic and Network Security Group (NSG) Functions between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>

In this project, we will observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups.<br/><br/>

<h2>ðŸš¨PrerequisitesðŸš¨</h2>

- [Creating Virtual Machines in the Cloud](https://github.com/mxwllslvr/creating-virtual-machines-in-the-cloud)
  
<h2>Technologies Utilized</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Compute/Virtual Machines)
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Windows App (macOS)
- PowerShell
- Network Protocols (ICMP, SSH, DHCP, DNS, RDP)
- Wireshark (Network Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems</h2>

- Windows 11 Home 24H2
- Windows 10 (22H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS

<h2>Procedure Overview</h2>

- Step 1: Establish RDP Connection to VM and Install Wireshark
- Step 2: Analyze ICMP Traffic
- Step 3: Configure NSG to Block Ping Requests
- Step 4: Examine SSH and DHCP Traffic
- Step 5: Investigate DNS and RDP Traffic

<h3>Step 1: Establishing RDP Connection to VM and Installing Wireshark</h3>

<p>Access Azure Portal: Log into your Azure account and navigate to the Virtual Machines section. 
<br/><br/>
Start VMs: Select both Windows-VM and Linux-VM by checking their boxes, then click Start. Confirm the action when prompted. Note the Public IP address of Windows-VM for later use.
<br/><br/>
Verify VM Status: After a few minutes, confirm both VMs are running by checking their status in the portal. Minimize the Azure window for now.</p>

<p>Initiate RDP Connection: On your local Windows device, open the Run dialog (Windows + R) and type mstsc to launch the Remote Desktop Connection client. Alternatively, search for Remote Desktop Connection in the Start menu.
<br>
Configure RDP Settings: In the Remote Desktop Connection window, enter the Windows-VM Public IP address in the Computer field. Click show options and enter the username established when provisioning the VM. Click connect, then enter the password we used with that username when the window pops up. Press Ok and establish the connection.</p>

<p>Install Wireshark: On Windows-VM, launch the Microsoft Edge browser and visit wireshark.org. Download the Windows x64 Installer. Locate the installer in the Downloads folder, run it, and follow the prompts, clicking Next and Finish to complete the installation.
<br>
Observation: You are now connected to windows-vm via RDP using mstsc, with Wireshark installed, enabling detailed network traffic analysis.</p>

<br/><br/><br/>

<h3>Step 2: Examining ICMP Traffic</h3>
<p><img width="850" alt="NSG2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b26dafaf-ecff-44fd-b32f-009bdf300a07"/></p>
<p>Start Wireshark: Open Wireshark on windows-vm. Select the Ethernet interface and click the shark fin icon to initiate packet capture.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="NSG2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0508be1-88c5-4256-b156-bb6032bfa200"/></p>
<p>Inspect Initial Traffic: Review the packet list in Wireshark, which displays all active network communications.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="NSG3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4afaef41-ae58-4505-93e4-b6f26aad3e0d"/></p>
<p>Filter for ICMP: Enter icmp in Wiresharkâ€™s filter bar and press Enter to focus on ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) traffic.</p>
