<h3>Step 1: Establishing RDP Connection to VM and Installing Wireshark</h3>

<img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20db9e4-591a-45b7-b0f9-db4361c83fbb"/></p>

<p>Access Azure Portal: Log into your Azure account and navigate to the Virtual Machines section. 
<br/><br/>
Start VMs: Select both Windows-VM and Linux-VM by checking their boxes, then click Start. Confirm the action when prompted. Note the Public IP address of Windows-VM for later use.
<br/><br/>
Verify VM Status: After a few minutes, confirm both VMs are running by checking their status in the portal. Minimize the Azure window for now.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8acef54-83c0-4944-93cf-67d34692bdc0"/></p>
<p>Initiate RDP Connection: Open the Run dialog (Windows + R) on your local Windows device and type mstsc to launch the Remote Desktop Connection client. Alternatively, you can search for Remote Desktop Connection in the Start menu.
<br/><br/>
Configure RDP Settings: In the Remote Desktop Connection window, enter the Windows-VM Public IP address in the Computer field. Click show options and enter the username established when provisioning the VM. Click connect, then enter the password we used with that username when the window pops up. Press Ok and establish the connection.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfa3401b-48d7-493c-af56-fe6fc63941d0"/></p>
<p>Install Wireshark: On Windows-VM, launch the Microsoft Edge browser and visit wireshark.org. Download the Windows x64 Installer. Locate the installer in the Downloads folder, run it, and follow the prompts, clicking Next and Finish to complete the installation.
<br/><br/>
Observation: You are now connected to Windows-VM via RDP using mstsc, with Wireshark installed, enabling detailed network traffic analysis.</p>
<br/><br/><br/>

<h3>Step 2: Examining ICMP Traffic</h3>
<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b26dafaf-ecff-44fd-b32f-009bdf300a07"/></p>
<p>Start Wireshark: Open Wireshark on Windows-VM. Select the Ethernet interface and click the shark fin icon to initiate packet capture.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="NSG2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0508be1-88c5-4256-b156-bb6032bfa200"/></p>
<p>Inspect Initial Traffic: Review the packet list in Wireshark, which displays all active network communications.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4afaef41-ae58-4505-93e4-b6f26aad3e0d"/></p>
<p>Filter for ICMP: Enter icmp in Wireshark‚Äôs filter bar and press Enter to focus on ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) traffic.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d776972-3021-41cf-9a66-66797134c7e0"/></p>
<p>Retrieve Linux VM Private IP: In the Azure Portal, select Linux VM, go to Networking, and note the Private IP address (e.g., 10.0.0.5). Minimize Azure.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99b934b4-0d80-4de2-a8ac-1da1838b0738"/></p>
<p>Execute Ping: On Windows-VM, open PowerShell via the Start menu search. Run ping 10.0.0.5 to send ICMP Echo Requests to the Linux VM.
<br/><br/>
Review Results: With the ICMP filter active, Wireshark shows packets from Windows-VM (e.g., 10.0.0.4) to Linux-VM (10.0.0.5) with corresponding replies. PowerShell displays successful ping responses.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22920261-8304-4b8e-b04c-f67b4679266f"/></p>
<p>Continuous Ping: In PowerShell, execute ping 10.0.0.5 -t to maintain ongoing ICMP traffic, visible as a steady stream in Wireshark.
<br/><br/>
Observation: Wireshark and PowerShell confirm robust ICMP connectivity between VMs, with continuous request-reply packets during the perpetual ping.</p>
<br/><br/><br/>

<h3>Step 3: Applying NSG Rule to Block Ping Requests</h3>
<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a17758a-b938-4f90-93ae-2916ef132e2f"/></p>
<p>Navigate to NSG: In the Azure Portal, go to Virtual Machines, select Linux-VM, and access Networking. Click the Linux-VM-NSG link under Network Security Group.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c753d21-25a9-4991-9346-243d6637b81b"/></p>
<p>Create Inbound Rule: In Inbound security rules, click + Add. Configure the rule as follows:
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -Source: Any
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -Source port ranges: * (all ports)
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -Destination port ranges: * (all ports)
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -Protocol: ICMPv4 (ping protocol)
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -Action: Deny
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -Priority: 290 (to prioritize this rule)
<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  -Click Add.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ade2ac7-8802-414c-9c54-7475ca72a4d1"/></p>
<p>Confirm Rule: Verify the new rule appears at the top of the inbound rules list.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c4f914e-54ce-404e-a8da-dfcf592b674c"/></p>
<p>Observe Ping Disruption: Return to windows-vm. In PowerShell, note the perpetual ping (ping 10.0.0.5 -t) now reports ‚ÄúRequest timed out‚Äù. Wireshark marks the timestamp when ICMP replies stop, reflecting the NSG rule‚Äôs effect.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5917fb5a-2b40-4b96-b0e0-8f68237c980b"/></p>
<p>Delete Rule: In Azure, revisit the NSG‚Äôs Inbound security rules, select the new rule, and click the trash can icon to remove it. Confirm deletion.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21574ba9-f455-4c11-8d4f-13d7f2b165c9"/></p>
<p>Verify Ping Restoration: On windows-vm, confirm in PowerShell that ping replies resume (e.g., ‚ÄúReply from 10.0.0.5‚Äù). Wireshark displays ICMP request-reply packets again. Terminate the perpetual ping with Ctrl + C in PowerShell.
<br/><br/>
Observation: The NSG rule successfully blocked ICMP traffic, interrupting pings, and its removal restored connectivity, illustrating NSG‚Äôs firewall capabilities.

<br/><br/><br/>

<h3>Step 4: Analyzing SSH and DHCP Traffic</h3>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99457421-b701-4209-b961-1cb4bec4e8ac"/></p>
<h4>Capture SSH Traffic:</h4>
<br/>
<p>In Wireshark, enter ssh in the filter bar and start a new capture.
<br/><br/>
In PowerShell, establish an SSH connection to linux-vm with ssh username@10.0.0.5 (substitute username with linux-vm‚Äôs username). Type yes to accept the connection prompt, then enter the password (the input field remains blank during entry).
<br/><br/>
Wireshark displays encrypted SSH packets, confirming a secure connection between VMs.
<br/><br/>
In PowerShell, type exit to terminate the session, observing the ‚ÄúConnection to 10.0.0.5 closed‚Äù message.</p>
<br/><br/>

<p><img width="850" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/662fb38f-be35-400a-adb0-c88f25a66a7f"/></p>
<h4>Capture DHCP Traffic:</h4>
<br/>
<p>In Wireshark, enter dhcp in the filter bar and start a new capture.
<br/><br/>
In PowerShell, run ipconfig /renew to request an IP lease. Note limited traffic due to the VM‚Äôs static IP configuration.
<br/><br/>
To trigger DHCP activity, create a batch file. Open Notepad on Windows-VM and enter:

```yaml

ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew

```

Press Windows + E to access Explorer, and navigate to C:\ folder. Click View, make sure Hidden Items is checked. Refresh the folder and save the Notepad file as dhcp.bat in the newly accessible C:\ProgramData.
