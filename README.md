In the Azure Portal, select **Linux VM**, go to **Networking**, and note the Private IP address (e.g., 10.0.0.5). Minimize Azure.

### Execute Ping Commands

![Ping Execution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99b934b4-0d80-4de2-a8ac-1da1838b0738)

1. On **Windows-VM**, open PowerShell via the Start menu search
2. Run `ping 10.0.0.5` to send ICMP Echo Requests to the Linux VM
3. **Review Results**: With the ICMP filter active, Wireshark shows packets from **Windows-VM** (e.g., 10.0.0.4) to **Linux-VM** (10.0.0.5) with corresponding replies. PowerShell displays successful ping responses

### Continuous Ping Test

![Continuous Ping](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22920261-8304-4b8e-b04c-f67b4679266f)

1. In PowerShell, execute `ping 10.0.0.5 -t` to maintain ongoing ICMP traffic
2. This appears as a steady stream in Wireshark

**Observation**: Wireshark and PowerShell confirm robust ICMP connectivity between VMs, with continuous request-reply packets during the perpetual ping.

---

## Step 3: Apply NSG Rule to Block Ping Requests

### Navigate to Network Security Group

![NSG Navigation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a17758a-b938-4f90-93ae-2916ef132e2f)

In the Azure Portal, go to **Virtual Machines**, select **Linux-VM**, and access **Networking**. Click the **Linux-VM-NSG** link under Network Security Group.

### Create Inbound Security Rule

![Create NSG Rule](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c753d21-25a9-4991-9346-243d6637b81b)

In **Inbound security rules**, click **+ Add**. Configure the rule as follows:

- **Source**: Any
- **Source port ranges**: * (all ports)
- **Destination port ranges**: * (all ports)
- **Protocol**: ICMPv4 (ping protocol)
- **Action**: Deny
- **Priority**: 290 (to prioritize this rule)

Click **Add**.

### Confirm Rule Creation

![Rule Confirmation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ade2ac7-8802-414c-9c54-7475ca72a4d1)

Verify the new rule appears at the top of the inbound rules list.

### Observe Ping Disruption

![Ping Blocked](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c4f914e-54ce-404e-a8da-dfcf592b674c)

Return to **Windows-VM**. In PowerShell, note the perpetual ping (`ping 10.0.0.5 -t`) now reports "Request timed out". Wireshark marks the timestamp when ICMP replies stop, reflecting the NSG rule's effect.

### Delete the NSG Rule

![Delete Rule](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5917fb5a-2b40-4b96-b0e0-8f68237c980b)

In Azure, revisit the NSG's **Inbound security rules**, select the new rule, and click the trash can icon to remove it. Confirm deletion.

### Verify Ping Restoration

![Ping Restored](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21574ba9-f455-4c11-8d4f-13d7f2b165c9)

1. On **Windows-VM**, confirm in PowerShell that ping replies resume (e.g., "Reply from 10.0.0.5")
2. Wireshark displays ICMP request-reply packets again
3. Terminate the perpetual ping with **Ctrl + C** in PowerShell

**Observation**: The NSG rule successfully blocked ICMP traffic, interrupting pings, and its removal restored connectivity, illustrating NSG's firewall capabilities.

## Step 4: Analyze SSH and DHCP Traffic

### Capture SSH Traffic

![SSH Traffic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99457421-b701-4209-b961-1cb4bec4e8ac)

1. In Wireshark, enter `ssh` in the filter bar and start a new capture
2. In PowerShell, establish an SSH connection to **Linux-VM** with `ssh username@10.0.0.5` (substitute username with **Linux-VM's** username)
3. Type `yes` to accept the connection prompt, then enter the password (the input field remains blank during entry)
4. Wireshark displays encrypted SSH packets, confirming a secure connection between VMs
5. In PowerShell, type `exit` to terminate the session, observing the "Connection to 10.0.0.5 closed" message

### Capture DHCP Traffic

![DHCP Traffic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/662fb38f-be35-400a-adb0-c88f25a66a7f)

1. In Wireshark, enter `dhcp` in the filter bar and start a new capture
2. In PowerShell, run `ipconfig /renew` to request an IP lease. Note limited traffic due to the VM's static IP configuration
3. To trigger DHCP activity, create a batch file:
   - Open Notepad on **Windows-VM** and enter:
     ```batch
     ipconfig /release
     ipconfig /renew
     ```
   - Press **Windows + E** to access Explorer, and navigate to **C:\** folder
   - Click **View**, make sure **Hidden Items** is checked. Refresh the folder
   - Save the Notepad file as `dhcp.bat` in the newly accessible **C:\ProgramData**

![DHCP Batch Execution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b56eafc-7928-4d6c-a81f-2ba439d0a883)

4. In PowerShell, navigate with `cd C:\ProgramData`, list files with `ls`, and execute the batch file with `.\dhcp.bat`
5. Observe a brief disconnection during `ipconfig /release`, followed by reconnection via `ipconfig /renew`
6. Wireshark captures DHCP packets (e.g., Discover, Offer, Request, ACK)

**Observation**: SSH traffic reveals encrypted communication, while the batch file generates observable DHCP lease negotiations, demonstrating IP assignment dynamics.

## Step 5: Evaluate DNS and RDP Traffic

### Capture DNS Traffic

![DNS Traffic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cc852e6-364b-45da-8fce-a14d27ab5f12)

1. In Wireshark, enter `dns` in the filter bar and start a new capture
2. In PowerShell, execute `nslookup disney.com` to resolve Disney's IP address (e.g., 130.211.198.204)
3. In Edge, navigate to the IP address. Note a Disney-related page (e.g., with a logo or error), indicating restricted access but confirming DNS's role in mapping domain names to IPs

### Capture RDP Traffic

![RDP Traffic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7178afb-b78e-4513-9daf-135555d42705)

1. In Wireshark, enter `tcp.port == 3389` in the filter bar to isolate RDP traffic, then start a new capture
2. Observe ongoing packet flow, reflecting the active RDP session to **Windows-VM** maintained throughout the exercise
3. Alternatively, filter with `rdp` to view similar traffic, verifying the protocol's continuous network activity during remote access

**Observation**: DNS traffic illustrates domain-to-IP resolution, while RDP traffic highlights the persistent network activity of remote connections, evident since the session's start.
